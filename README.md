# Medical Report Diagnosis Streamlit App üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

### Overview
This Streamlit application is designed to assist in the analysis and diagnosis of medical reports, specifically pathology laboratory blood test reports. The app allows users to upload medical reports in either JPG/JPEG or PDF formats.

- **Text Summarization**: Utilizes the meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct language model from Hugging Face to generate concise summaries of the extracted text.
